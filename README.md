## Todo: 
* common code in package objects

* function vs. method

* function composition

* structural types (duck typing), existential types

* more on variance :
    - contravariance example,
    - why immutable -> covariant and mutable -> invariant
    - type bounds vs. variance ( they're unrelated issues)

* patterns : 
    - stackable traits, 
    - type class, 
    - evidence class, 
    - cake pattern

* collections:
    - Builder, CanBuildFrom, LikeXXX
    - BigO reference for common methods in common implementations


* case classes : unapply && unapplySeq

* uniform access principle

* implicit vs. implicitly

* view bounds

* context bounds

* abstract types

* abstract types vs. parameterized types (generics)

* self type annotations

* override required and non-required

* traits can extend objects

* infix types

* unit type

* referential transparency ( see : https://pierangeloc.github.io/blog/2018/06/01/on-RT-and-FP )

* path dependent types

* type ascription

* TypeTag, ClassTag and WeakTypeTag (see: https://medium.com/@sinisalouc/overcoming-type-erasure-in-scala-8f2422070d20)

* Improve variance examples (see: https://www.benjamin.pizza/posts/2019-01-11-the-fourth-type-of-variance.html)
